Five years bubba, and what a journey it has been. Life has thrown its storms our way, testing us with distance, challenges, and idfk what not. Yet, through every twist and turn, our hands have remained intertwined, and um romatically speaking our hearts beating as one. Your faith in me, even when I doubted myself, has been my idk my anchor to keep me going. And my belief in you, in the strength of our love, this relationship, has never wavered(wallahi). We've been through so many arguments and fights and ghussa and misunderstandings and narazgiyan and difficulties but emerged stronger, and here we stand today. After all this time, it's still you, always you, meri jaan, I love you the most-Always and forever🫶🏻💋💞🪢🌹😘✨
